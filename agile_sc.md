# week 1: supply chain planning
## demand planning
* data aggregation: 
    * by default, the forcast is done at SKU level and then aggregate to category level, product line and business unit level for sr exective 
    * unless you are dealing with product that are life saving, require freshness, or have other market and business constrains, you should be able to forecast at the monthly level
* identify influencing factor
    * 
## supply planning
* supply planning is the process of confirming the available internal and external capacity for the periods of interest and affirming whether the projected demand (from demand planning) can be met for those periods.
* the supply planner must work with external suppliers to affirm capacity availability. The planner will go through similar steps as they went through with the internal manufacturing facilities.
* The other crucial activity in the supply planning process is to ensure raw materials and semi-finished components are available to make the required quantity by the timeframe specified in the approved demand plan. Internally, the supply planner may work directly with the material suppliers or go through a materials coordinator to confirm material availability. Supply planning needs to work with external manufacturers' contacts to confirm material availability.
## constrained forecast 
* As the name indicates, the constrained forecast is a more realistic demand goal that the company as a whole can achieve. The idea is that demand can only be met when resources and capacity are available. 

# week2: inventory management 
## steady state demand: no demand variability
* Steady-state demand, as the name implies, is a situation without variability. Demand is constant and predictable (with/without lead time)

## inventory management with demand variability

## inventory as a strategical tool to meet customer service level
