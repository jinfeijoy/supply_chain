# Course 1: Supply Chain Logistics (Transportation / Warehousing / Inventory)
## Transportation
* motor freight:
 * advantage: speed / reliability / low damage / accessibility
 * truck connected by terminals:
  * pickup/delivery terminal: from city truch to line-hall vehicle
  * cross docks: connect networks of transportation together
  * relay terminals: switch out the cab and put a trailer on a new cab
 * Cost Structure
  * fuel 39% 
  * driver salary 26%
  * cab and trailer 17%
  * maintenance 12% 
  * insurance and fees 5%
* air freight:
      * Cost Structure
            * Government support of highway structure: (70-90%)
            * Terminals not too capital intensive: (10-30%)
      * Air Freight Service Characteristics
            * Emergency shipments
            * Typical commodities include mail, communications products, racehorses, etc.
            * Speed of service considerations
            * Speed, travel time advantage can be off-set by flight frequency and timing
            * Smaller communities have experienced reduced frequencies
            * In-direct routing due to hub and spoke networks
      * High variable costs (about 60% of total, but can be as high as 80%)
            * About 30% attributable to flight operations
            * About 12% for maintenance
            * About 17% for aircraft and traffic servicing
* intermodal and express delivery
      * intermodal: containers on a train + truck
      * express delivery
      * Rail is the cheapest and reasonably fast over long distances
      * Motor is fast for short distances and can pickup and deliver everywhere
      * Air is fastest and cost is justified for certain items.
## Warehousing 
* warehousing Management
      * Purpose of warehousing setup: efficiencies / risk pooling / service
      * function: movement / storage / information (about inventory)
      * why to use warehouse: speed / quality / productivity
      * [design a warehouse] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-logistics/supplement/IgLSe/warehousing-best-practices): shortest distance / quality & redundancy / throughput
* inventory Management
      * how much inventory
          * cycle stock
          * safety stock
              * reason: logistic / demand are uncertain 
      * when to order inventory
          * reorder point
