# Course 1: Supply Chain Logistics (Transportation / Warehousing / Inventory)
## Transportation
* motor freight:
 * advantage: speed / reliability / low damage / accessibility
    * truck connected by terminals:
        * pickup/delivery terminal: from city truch to line-hall vehicle
        * cross docks: connect networks of transportation together
        * relay terminals: switch out the cab and put a trailer on a new cab
    * Cost Structure
        * fuel 39% 
        * driver salary 26%
        * cab and trailer 17%
        * maintenance 12% 
        * insurance and fees 5%
* air freight:
   * Cost Structure
      * Government support of highway structure: (70-90%)
      * Terminals not too capital intensive: (10-30%)
   * Air Freight Service Characteristics
      * Emergency shipments
      * Typical commodities include mail, communications products, racehorses, etc.
      * Speed of service considerations
      * Speed, travel time advantage can be off-set by flight frequency and timing
      * Smaller communities have experienced reduced frequencies
      * In-direct routing due to hub and spoke networks
   * High variable costs (about 60% of total, but can be as high as 80%)
      * About 30% attributable to flight operations
      * About 12% for maintenance
      * About 17% for aircraft and traffic servicing
* intermodal and express delivery
     * intermodal: containers on a train + truck
     * express delivery
     * Rail is the cheapest and reasonably fast over long distances
     * Motor is fast for short distances and can pickup and deliver everywhere
     * Air is fastest and cost is justified for certain items.
## Warehousing 
* warehousing Management
     * Purpose of warehousing setup: efficiencies / risk pooling / service
     * function: movement / storage / information (about inventory)
     * why to use warehouse: speed / quality / productivity
     * [design a warehouse] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-logistics/supplement/IgLSe/warehousing-best-practices): shortest distance / quality & redundancy / throughput
* inventory Management
     * how much inventory
          * cycle stock
          * safety stock
              * reason: logistic / demand are uncertain 
     * when to order inventory
          * reorder point

## Logistics Network Design
* how many and where
* factors influencing logistics networks: cost vs service (tradeoff)
     * interest high -> cost of inventory goes up, fewer warehouse 
     * fule high -> transportation expensive, more warehouse  
* striving for logistics customer service: the overall goal of logistics is to deliver the right product, at the right price, to the right customer, at the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity, in the right condition. 


# Course 2: Supply Chain Operations
## goal of operation
* goal of operation: cost, speed, quality, flexibility
* lean operation
   * Number 1, you want to specify value from the customer's perspective.
   * Number 2, you look at your whole supply chain and you map out where that value is created. You create a value stream map.
   * Number 3, you want to make that value flow. In other words, you discontinue all activities that do not add value, and accelerate the activities that do add value.
   * Fourth, you want to pull back from the customer. And that is a very important idea. Rather than producing and hoping that your customer will buy the product, ie pushing the product onto the customer, you want to wait for the customer to ask for a product and then you start producing it.
   * And finally, you want to strive for perfection and eliminate all defects.
## Six sigma
* define: background and goals, scope, project milestonrs, budget
* measure
* analyze
   * equipment, process, people, materials, environment, management
* improve
   * 5S: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, sustain
* control 
# Course 3: Supply Chain Planning
* sales plan
* manufacturer plan
* distribution plan
* supply plan

# Course 4: Supply Chain Sourcing

# Course 5: Supply Chain Management Strategy
