## [Supply Chain Analytical -- Coursera Course Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/programs/manulife-learning-program-zgh8l/specializations/supply-chain-analytics)

### Course 1: Supply Chain Analytics Essentials
#### Week 1
* Top use case for supply chain:
  * optimization tools
  * demand forecasting
  * integrated business planning
  * supplier collaboration and risk analytics

  * ability to manage global/virtual teams
  * ability to persuade and communicate effectively
  * leading and developing others  

#### Week 2
* Supply Chain Management:
  * objective: improve revenue and reduce cost
  * methodology: to produce and distribute the merchandize in the right quantities, to the right locations and at the right time, to minimize system wide cost and maximize customer service levels.
  * Dell outperformed Compaq by 1% in operating margin, and it is critical, which means even with the lower price, they can make the same money.
  * Walmart vs Amazon, which one is future retailer? Amazon has higher operating efficiency by comparing the following matrics, the gap on total revenue is closing down, amazon already caught up walmart on operating income:
    * inventory days
    * cash conversion cycle
    * labor productivity
    * payable days / receiable days  
* Suuply Chain Management Challenges
  * Complex network of facilities & product (hard to optimize)
  * Dynamic, seasonal and random (hard to predict)
  * Self-interested partners with different objectives (hard to coordinate)
* Analytics are no longer a nice to have (from information to optimization):
  * what happened: descriptive analytics
  * why did it happen: diagnostic analytics
  * what will happen: predictive analytics
  * how can we make it happen : prescriptive analytics

#### Week 3: Demand Planning
* Sell (Demand) Analytics:
  * demand planning
  * product selection, pricing & promotion
    * pain point:
      * offer price discount but demand stays the same, lose profit
      * offer price discount and demand skyrockets, stock-out and lose sales and customer good faith 
    * analytical solution:
      * accurately predict price elasticity
      * select the right products and timing for promotion
      * increase profit and improve customer satisfaction 
* Move (Logistics) Analytics
  * fulfillment diagnostics (root cause analysis for traffic / inventory): higher demand delays fulfillment 
  * distribution & logistics planning
    * balance the needs of shipping and inventory by achieving a global optimum with reduced total cost and improved service level (cost distribution for different category cost for pull/push strategy) 
  * transportation management: truck-pool (load) optimization
* Make (Production) Analytics
  * production planing, workforce management
  * inventory management 
* Source (Purchasing) Analytics
  * strategic sourcing, supplier management
  * order management 

### Course 2: Business Intelligence and Competitive Analysis

   * identify strength & weakness, also see problems & opportunities
   * Five forces - industry analysis
      * Threat, rivalry and substitutes: existing & potential competitors - be prepared to defend yourself - competition positioning
      * Bargaining power of suppliers and buyers: the power of suppliers and customers - promote your value in the supply chain - value chain analysis
   * SWOT analysis - company analysis
      * strength, weakness, oppotunities, threats(elements in the external environment that could endanger the integrity and profitability of the business)
    * Three layers of analytics approach for competitive intelligence

   * ![Screen Shot 2024-06-03 at 4 09 57 PM](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/0caff2d7-d140-4156-8cf2-2fb2e50a0905)
   * GICS (supply chain based) -> 11 Sectors -> 24 industry groups -> 68 industries -> 157 sub-industries
   * [GCPS Navigator](scdata.ai/navigator) -> used to identify company industry 
* world's major economies 
   * total number of enterpries/ total operating income or loss/ total revenue / liabilities / total net income / total inventory / total revenue growth rate / total operating income growth rate / total net income growth rate / labor productivity
   * leading economies: from 33,000+ companies and over 20 stock exchange market (size / growth) 
   * leading contries by different industry
   * industry trend 

#### Week 2: industry analysis
* market potential (industry trend) and risk
   * Market potential
      * competition / life cycle/ profit/ ROA/ Size/ Growth/ Trend 
   * Company performance
      * size / growth / profitability / efficiency / competition 
   * industrial comparison
      * profitability: total revenue / total operating income / median revenue / median operation margin / median net margin / break-even profitability
      * growth: total revenue growth rate / total operating income growth rate / median revenue growth rate / median operating income growth rate
      * efficiency: median sales general admin cost / total revenue/ median return on assets/ median return on invested capital
      * efficiency: labor productivity = revenue / # of employees
      * efficiency: market power = payable days / receivable days
   * market risk:
      * profit vs cost - operating income (plot with cost as x and income or loss as y)
      * breakdown revenue (cost of revenue/ SG&A expense/ tax / net income / other cost)
   * Instructions:
      * Questions addressed: The starting point of competitive intelligence is often to understand the market potential, trend, risk, and the concentration / competition intensity. One may ask questions such as,
          * What is the size of the market?
          * Does it have a significant growth and / or profit potential?
          * Which stage of the life-cycle (sun-rise, stable or saturated, sun-set) is it on?
          * What is the risk of a significant loss?
          * How intensive is the competition?
      * Analysis instructions:In general, you need to specify a few parameters for the analysis, such as, analysis module (e.g., profitability, growth, financial health, efficiency, etc.), level of industry classification (level 4 refers to the finest level) and industry, country or state, and fiscal year.
      * Interperate results:
          * **The profit vs. growth trade-off**: It is ideal for an industry to be both high growth and high profit, but it rarely happens. We may find an industry either high growth but low profit, or low growth but high profit, which one is preferred? In my opinion, growth is more important than profitability. This is true because often high growth but low profit represents a sun-rise industry, but low growth and high profit signals a relatively saturated market.
          * **Large market, high growth but low chance to break even**: The US health care sector seems to be in a contradictory situation as it has one of the largest total market sizes, highest growth (both revenue and profits), but in the same time, the lowest (20%) chance of breaking even! What happened is that many small companies are formed to research, develop and commercialize new drugs, which is highly risky but if successful, extremely profitable. US IT sector faces a similar situation with intensive innovations, higher risk than most other countries, but a large competitive market with many small companies.
          * **Transportation industry structure vs. trade structure**: The US economy is more than balanced between international and domestic trade than China, not only because trucking is high in the US but low in China, and marine is high in china but low in the US, but also because of the shipping rates. Indeed, airfreight shipping rates are typically 9x that of trucking, and the shipping rates of trucking are typically 2x that of marine.
          * **Larger market and smaller companies vs. smaller market but larger companies**: If you compare US health care and US materials sectors, you will find an interesting phenomenon: the health care sector has the second largest total market size (total revenue of all health care companies) but the smallest median company revenue. On the contrary, the materials sector has one of the smallest total market size but the largest median company revenue. The insight behind this observation is that health care is competitive market where small companies can survive and grow but materials is highly monopolized where smaller companies do not exist.
            
* competition intensity, value chain analysis
    * objective:
       * the most valuable element of the supply chain
       * stay focused or diversify
       * who has the market power
    * check metrics: profitability / growth / efficiency



#### Week 3: Competition positioning
* competitive landscape 
   * Where do I stand in the industry (competition positioning)
      *  Revenue vs cost (y as revenue, x as cost): can be used primarily to identify companies' positions and leagues by sizes (total revenue and cost)
      *  operating income or loss vs total cost: primarily identifies their positions in profitability and shows which companies can make more money with less cost
      *  operating income or loss vs total assets: positions the companies on the asset utilization map. 
      *  
   * which companies are my league (cluster)
   * how far am I away from the profit frontier
      * operating margin vs revenue
      * return on assets vs liability asset ratio
   * Return vs. risk:
      * Unlike the usual interpretation of return vs. risk in financial investment, return vs. risk in competitive intelligence puts all companies of an industry on a map of two important KPIs: return on assets and liability asset ratio. Return on assets does not necessarily increase as the liability asset ratio increases. In fact, for capital equipment / plants intensive industries, such as airlines, the opposite trend may be true
* enterprise ranking
   *  size, profit, ROA
   *  larger size but smaller profit / smaller size but larger profit
* KPI examination of enterprises

   * strength and weakness
      * size (total revenue / net income /  profit before tax / operating income or loss / gross profit)
      * profitability (gross margin / return on assets / net margin / operating margin)
      * return on investment ( return on equity / assets / invested capital)
   *  trend
      * size (total revenue / operating income or loss)
      * financial health (current ratio / liability asset ratio / long term debt ratio)  
* value driver
   * drivers (industry dependent)
      * what factor drive a company's performance in this industry
         *  equipment and asset-intensive industries: liability -> margins / ROA (negative correlation)
         *  retailing companies: (pricing) gross margin -> revenue growth (negative correlation)
         *  inventory-intensive industries: inventory turn over -> asset turn over / margins (negative correlation)
         *  gross margin -> operating /net margin, but if we find a reverse case, then we might hit a home run 

* breakdown analysis: breakdown the revenue, cost and assets to analyze and compare their components, to diagnose root cause for problems
   * <img width="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/2be7a9c9-4ba4-42c8-9914-37823340931c">

   * The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or little money, Warren said. Think airlines -- Warren Buffet
 
### Course 3: Demand Analytics
#### Week1
* Demand planning and forecasting:
  * demand is random & highly seasonal
  * accurate demand forecast is critical to success - to avoid inventory shortage and customer backorders / reducing over time production, excessive inventories, and expedited shipping costs.
  * objective
     * forecast 2013 full year demand - factory can increase production during the summer to meet the demand in Q4
     * accurate forecast for 3-month forward - sourcing, production, shipping take time
     * minimize backorders, over-time production and over-stock 
* Overview
   * pain point:
      * at new product launch, demand can be hard to predict
      * yet accurate forecast is needed for sourcing, production, distribution and advertising planning
   *  demand analytics
      * accurately predict the demand for new products
      * assess the impact of various factors on the demand (time/ seasonality / price / other environmental factors)
   * [Four Pillars of Demand Planning Excellence](https://www.academia.edu/35321947/Four_Pillars_of_Demand_Planning_Excellence)
   * process in practice

          * Each year, they started with an annual forecast. 
          * With each month passing by, they update the forecast based on the latest events and data. 
          * Using the updated forecast, they then created monthly production plan for the finished goods, which is broken down by its material requirement planning system into parts procurement plan and weekly assembly schedule. 
          * An effective demand planning and accurate forecasting can improve the company's financial performance significantly.
              * less inventory / better order fulfillment / shorter cash cycle time
              * better profit margin / better EPS (Earning Per Share) / higher ROA / less shortage of peers

#### Week2 ( data visualization/ predict trend)
* linear regression

#### Week3 (model validation and improvement, predicting the impact of price and other environmental factors)

### Course 4: Inventory Analytics
#### Week1: how much inventory do we carry
* driving forces behind retailling industry
   * challenge: do not know what customers want when they enter your online or offline stores / have to provide the right product at the right price
   * Components: price / product variety / delivery / cash cycle
* inventory management
   * SP500 retailing companies typically have 25-44% of their total assets in inventory
   * inventory management -> sales and operations planning (S&OP)
      * product variety and availability
      * excessive inventory   
* inventory problems
   * for which industries is inventory important
   * how many inventory drive a company's financial performance
   * how do I know that I have an inventory problem
   * how to classify inventory and manage them accordingly 
* Value, trend, breadkwon and economic indications
   * inventory efficiency improve before 2006, but was disrupted by the financial crisis. And afterwards, inventory efficiency was dropping.
   * ![image](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/c7640dac-7390-465a-96d1-f8662de00e38)
   * inventory in supply chains:
      * retail (35%)
      * manufacturing (39%)
         *  materials and supplies (34%)
         *  half finished products - work-in-progress (31%)
         *  finished goods (35%)
      * wholesale (26%)
   * inventory change over time
      * First, China's inventory changes follow the pattern of the US. But are slightly lagged behind and much more dramatic than the US in recent years. Part of the reason is that China was supplying US.
      * And second, the times of major economic recessions coincides well with the negative changes of inventory. In fact, a significant and negative change of inventory is a strong indicator of economic recession.
      * And thirdly, the changes swing bigger and bigger as time goes by with an almost exponential growth.
      * And finally, Germany has a different pattern in inventory changes from the US. A significant and consistent reduction of inventory in recent years indicating a very different industrial practice on inventory management

#### Week2: in which industries may inventory be important
* assessing industries by inventory over total assets
   * US
      * major industry sectors: ![image](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/38f97dc8-feb8-4366-9f25-b394b8d18a87)

* Assess the importance by inventory days (measure inventory relative to demand) (country dependent)
   * inventory turns = annual COGS / inventory investment: how many times inventory is sold and replaced
   * ![image](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/37d371eb-65c1-495a-94e2-6c3c7eba43a5)
   * inventory days (DOS) = # of business days in a year / inventory turns : average days the item is held in inventory

   * US: healthcare consistently has the highest inventory days/ followed by IT&comsumer staples / energy has the lowest
   * China: real estate consistently has the highest / followed by health care / telecom has the lowest
* [software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inventoryanalytics/supplement/N8r4D/software-tools)
  
#### Week3: how may inventory drive a firm's financial performance? how do I know that I have an inventory problem
* why hold inventory: to reduce excessive inventory and only keep active inventory
   * cycle stock: to take advantage of the scale economy: fixed ordering cost & switch over times -> **how much to order**
   * safety stock: to protect against uncertainty: demand surge, suppliers may stock out -> **when to order**
   * forward-buy stock: to take advantage of price discount
   * pipeline stock: to ship product over a long distnace - inventory in transit
   * prebuilt stock: to make up for the limited production capacity - seasonal demand
* why not hold inventory
   * additional space and handling / opportunity cost of capital / spoilage obsolescence / hide problems in manufacturing procsese causing quality problems
   * holding cost breakdown
      * inventory holding cost
         * opportunity cost of alternative investment: 8%
         * cost of storage: 6%
         * taxes and insurance: 2%
         * breakage, spoilage & obsolescence: 1%
* How may inventory drive financial performance
   * as inventory turnover increase, the gross margin may decrease for US retailing
   * as inventory turnover increase, operating cost over revenue may decrease for US retailing
   * as inventory turnover increase, the asset turnover may increase for US retailing
* how do I know if I have an inventory problem
   * ranking inventory days, then compare the following matrics:
      *  total revenue / groww profit / net income / operating income or loss / profit b efore tax
      *  asset turnover days ; inventory days ; cash conversion cycle ; sales general admin cost / total revenue; receivable days / payable days
   * trend analysis: inventory days / cash conversion cycle /labor productivity / payable days (receivable days) / total revenue growth rate / operating income growth rate / net income growth rate
   * revenue breakdown analysis: cost of revenue or COGS / SG&A Expenses / research development / income tax / net income / other cost
   * asset breakdown: cash and cash equivalents / short term investment / net receivables / inventory / long term investment / property plant and equipment / intangible assets / goodwill / others

#### Week4: how to classify and manage inventory 
* ABC analysis: 3 categories of inventory items of different importance and strategies - A,B,C depending on their percentages of spend / consumption
   *  ABC analysis:
      *  A: 10-20% of items : 60-80% of cost
      *  B: 20-30% of itmes : 20-30% of cost
      *  C: 50-70% of items: < 20% of cost
      *  ![image](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/8c7c9b2a-f6d0-4839-8438-912ca9630403)
   *  Steps in ABC analysis
      *  First, determine the usage, annually, monthly, or weekly, and so on in units of each item.
      *  Second, multiply the usage by the unit cost to get the spend or consumption for each item.
      *  Third, rank the spend or consumption from high to low.
      *  Fourth, calculate the cumulative spend in dollar value and in percentage.
      *  Finally, classify the items into A, B, C classes or types, and draw the Pareto chart.
* Manage inventory by class or type
   * ![image](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/2050d6c5-0517-4eca-add9-b4b0e40d1488)
   * A: you frequently used; accounted for the most of your cost / spend ; most important -> close monitoring and control 
      * develop a relationship with the supplier
      * adjusting demand forecasts and inventory policies frequently  
   * B: you occasionally used; accounted for a small but not negligible part of your cost / spend ; less important -> less attention and control
      * adjust demand forecast and inventory policy less frequently
      * order them less frequently, e.g. monthly
   * C: you rarely used ; enormous in variety but each is negligible in cost (however, the total may not be); may be important but not worthy of carrying inventory -> delegate to suppliers or 3rd party
      *  order as needed
* inventory management in practice
   * ways to manage inventory
      * quantitative approaches: better models and software for inventory management (16.2%)
      * reduced lead time (15%)
      * improved forecasting (10.7%)
      * more attention to inventory management, e.g. tight management of usage rates, lead times and safety stock (6.6%)
      * reduction in SKU (5.1%)
      * others, e.g. shift more inventory, or inventory ownership, to trading partners (suppliers) 
   *
