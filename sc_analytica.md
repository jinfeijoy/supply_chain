## [Supply Chain Analytical -- Coursera Course Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/programs/manulife-learning-program-zgh8l/specializations/supply-chain-analytics)

### Course 1: Supply Chain Analytics Essentials
#### Week 1
* Top use case for supply chain:
  * optimization tools
  * demand forecasting
  * integrated business planning
  * supplier collaboration and risk analytics
* Leaders' capability
  * ability to negotiate and collaborate
  * ability to collaborate across functions
  * ability to drive or support diversity and inclusion
  * strategic thinking and problem solving
  * ability to manage global/virtual teams
  * ability to persuade and communicate effectively
  * leading and developing others  

#### Week 2
* Supply Chain Management:
  * objective: improve revenue and reduce cost
  * methodology: to produce and distribute the merchandize in the right quantities, to the right locations and at the right time, to minimize system wide cost and maximize customer service levels.
  * Dell outperformed Compaq by 1% in operating margin, and it is critical, which means even with the lower price, they can make the same money.
  * Walmart vs Amazon, which one is future retailer? Amazon has higher operating efficiency by comparing the following matrics, the gap on total revenue is closing down, amazon already caught up walmart on operating income:
    * inventory days
    * cash conversion cycle
    * labor productivity
    * payable days / receiable days  
* Suuply Chain Management Challenges
  * Complex network of facilities & product (hard to optimize)
  * Dynamic, seasonal and random (hard to predict)
  * Self-interested partners with different objectives (hard to coordinate)
* Analytics are no longer a nice to have (from information to optimization):
  * what happened: descriptive analytics
  * why did it happen: diagnostic analytics
  * what will happen: predictive analytics
  * how can we make it happen : prescriptive analytics

#### Week 3: Demand Planning
* Sell (Demand) Analytics:
  * demand planning
  * product selection, pricing & promotion
    * pain point:
      * offer price discount but demand stays the same, lose profit
      * offer price discount and demand skyrockets, stock-out and lose sales and customer good faith 
    * analytical solution:
      * accurately predict price elasticity
      * select the right products and timing for promotion
      * increase profit and improve customer satisfaction 
* Move (Logistics) Analytics
  * fulfillment diagnostics (root cause analysis for traffic / inventory): higher demand delays fulfillment 
  * distribution & logistics planning
    * balance the needs of shipping and inventory by achieving a global optimum with reduced total cost and improved service level (cost distribution for different category cost for pull/push strategy) 
  * transportation management: truck-pool (load) optimization
* Make (Production) Analytics
  * production planing, workforce management
  * inventory management 
* Source (Purchasing) Analytics
  * strategic sourcing, supplier management
  * order management 

### Course 2: Business Intelligence and Competitive Analysis

* Competitive intelligence framework, benchmarking
   * compare companies in the same business / industry
   * identify strength & weakness, also see problems & opportunities
   * Five forces - industry analysis
      * Threat, rivalry and substitutes: existing & potential competitors - be prepared to defend yourself - competition positioning
      * Bargaining power of suppliers and buyers: the power of suppliers and customers - promote your value in the supply chain - value chain analysis
   * SWOT analysis - company analysis
      * strength, weakness, oppotunities, threats(elements in the external environment that could endanger the integrity and profitability of the business)
    * Three layers of analytics approach for competitive intelligence
      * Industry analysis
         * market potential and risk
         * competition intensity, entry barriers
         * value chain analysis

      * enterprise diagnosis
         * strengths & weaknesses
         * levers & drivers
         * revenue / assets structure, problem and causes 
* industry classifications (supply chain based classification)
   * sectors -> groups -> multiple industry 
   * ![Screen Shot 2024-06-03 at 4 09 57 PM](https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/0caff2d7-d140-4156-8cf2-2fb2e50a0905)
   * GICS (supply chain based) -> 11 Sectors -> 24 industry groups -> 68 industries -> 157 sub-industries
   * [GCPS Navigator](scdata.ai/navigator) -> used to identify company industry 
* world's major economies 
   * total number of enterpries/ total operating income or loss/ total revenue / liabilities / total net income / total inventory / total revenue growth rate / total operating income growth rate / total net income growth rate / labor productivity
   * leading economies: from 33,000+ companies and over 20 stock exchange market (size / growth) 
   * leading contries by different industry
   * industry trend 

#### Week 2: industry analysis
* market potential (industry trend) and risk
   * Market potential
      * competition / life cycle/ profit/ ROA/ Size/ Growth/ Trend 
   * Company performance
      * size / growth / profitability / efficiency / competition 
   * industrial comparison
      * profitability: total revenue / total operating income / median revenue / median operation margin / median net margin / break-even profitability
      * growth: total revenue growth rate / total operating income growth rate / median revenue growth rate / median operating income growth rate
      * efficiency: median sales general admin cost / total revenue/ median return on assets/ median return on invested capital
      * efficiency: labor productivity = revenue / # of employees
      * efficiency: market power = payable days / receivable days
   * market risk:
      * profit vs cost - operating income (plot with cost as x and income or loss as y)
      * breakdown revenue (cost of revenue/ SG&A expense/ tax / net income / other cost)
   * Instructions:
      * Questions addressed: The starting point of competitive intelligence is often to understand the market potential, trend, risk, and the concentration / competition intensity. One may ask questions such as,
          * What is the size of the market?
          * Does it have a significant growth and / or profit potential?
          * Which stage of the life-cycle (sun-rise, stable or saturated, sun-set) is it on?
          * What is the risk of a significant loss?
          * How intensive is the competition?
      * Analysis instructions:In general, you need to specify a few parameters for the analysis, such as, analysis module (e.g., profitability, growth, financial health, efficiency, etc.), level of industry classification (level 4 refers to the finest level) and industry, country or state, and fiscal year.
      * Interperate results:
          * **The profit vs. growth trade-off**: It is ideal for an industry to be both high growth and high profit, but it rarely happens. We may find an industry either high growth but low profit, or low growth but high profit, which one is preferred? In my opinion, growth is more important than profitability. This is true because often high growth but low profit represents a sun-rise industry, but low growth and high profit signals a relatively saturated market.
          * **Large market, high growth but low chance to break even**: The US health care sector seems to be in a contradictory situation as it has one of the largest total market sizes, highest growth (both revenue and profits), but in the same time, the lowest (20%) chance of breaking even! What happened is that many small companies are formed to research, develop and commercialize new drugs, which is highly risky but if successful, extremely profitable. US IT sector faces a similar situation with intensive innovations, higher risk than most other countries, but a large competitive market with many small companies.
          * **Transportation industry structure vs. trade structure**: The US economy is more than balanced between international and domestic trade than China, not only because trucking is high in the US but low in China, and marine is high in china but low in the US, but also because of the shipping rates. Indeed, airfreight shipping rates are typically 9x that of trucking, and the shipping rates of trucking are typically 2x that of marine.
          * **Larger market and smaller companies vs. smaller market but larger companies**: If you compare US health care and US materials sectors, you will find an interesting phenomenon: the health care sector has the second largest total market size (total revenue of all health care companies) but the smallest median company revenue. On the contrary, the materials sector has one of the smallest total market size but the largest median company revenue. The insight behind this observation is that health care is competitive market where small companies can survive and grow but materials is highly monopolized where smaller companies do not exist.
            
* competition intensity, value chain analysis
    * objective:
       * the most valuable element of the supply chain
       * stay focused or diversify
       * who has the market power
    * check metrics: profitability / growth / efficiency



#### Week 3: Competition positioning
* competitive landscape 
   * Where do I stand in the industry (competition positioning)
      *  Revenue vs cost (y as revenue, x as cost): can be used primarily to identify companies' positions and leagues by sizes (total revenue and cost)
      *  operating income or loss vs total cost: primarily identifies their positions in profitability and shows which companies can make more money with less cost
      *  operating income or loss vs total assets: positions the companies on the asset utilization map. 
      *  
   * which companies are my league (cluster)
   * how far am I away from the profit frontier
      * operating margin vs revenue
      * return on assets vs liability asset ratio
   * Return vs. risk:
      * Unlike the usual interpretation of return vs. risk in financial investment, return vs. risk in competitive intelligence puts all companies of an industry on a map of two important KPIs: return on assets and liability asset ratio. Return on assets does not necessarily increase as the liability asset ratio increases. In fact, for capital equipment / plants intensive industries, such as airlines, the opposite trend may be true
* enterprise ranking
   *  size, profit, ROA
   *  larger size but smaller profit / smaller size but larger profit
* KPI examination of enterprises

#### Week 4: Enterprise Diagnosis
* strength and weakness, trends
   * strength and weakness
      * size (total revenue / net income /  profit before tax / operating income or loss / gross profit)
      * profitability (gross margin / return on assets / net margin / operating margin)
      * return on investment ( return on equity / assets / invested capital)
   *  trend
      * size (total revenue / operating income or loss)
      * financial health (current ratio / liability asset ratio / long term debt ratio)  
* value driver
   * drivers (industry dependent)
      * what factor drive a company's performance in this industry
         *  equipment and asset-intensive industries: liability -> margins / ROA (negative correlation)
         *  retailing companies: (pricing) gross margin -> revenue growth (negative correlation)
         *  inventory-intensive industries: inventory turn over -> asset turn over / margins (negative correlation)
         *  gross margin -> operating /net margin, but if we find a reverse case, then we might hit a home run 

* breakdown analysis: breakdown the revenue, cost and assets to analyze and compare their components, to diagnose root cause for problems
   * <img width="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jinfeijoy/supply_chain/assets/16402963/2be7a9c9-4ba4-42c8-9914-37823340931c">

   * The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or little money, Warren said. Think airlines -- Warren Buffet
 
### Course 3: Demand Analytics
#### Week1
* Demand planning and forecasting:
  * demand is random & highly seasonal
  * accurate demand forecast is critical to success - to avoid inventory shortage and customer backorders / reducing over time production, excessive inventories, and expedited shipping costs.
  * objective
     * forecast 2013 full year demand - factory can increase production during the summer to meet the demand in Q4
     * accurate forecast for 3-month forward - sourcing, production, shipping take time
     * minimize backorders, over-time production and over-stock 
* Overview
   * pain point:
      * at new product launch, demand can be hard to predict
      * yet accurate forecast is needed for sourcing, production, distribution and advertising planning
   *  demand analytics
      * accurately predict the demand for new products
      * assess the impact of various factors on the demand (time/ seasonality / price / other environmental factors)
   * [Four Pillars of Demand Planning Excellence](https://www.academia.edu/35321947/Four_Pillars_of_Demand_Planning_Excellence)
   * process in practice

          * Each year, they started with an annual forecast. 
          * With each month passing by, they update the forecast based on the latest events and data. 
          * Using the updated forecast, they then created monthly production plan for the finished goods, which is broken down by its material requirement planning system into parts procurement plan and weekly assembly schedule. 
          * An effective demand planning and accurate forecasting can improve the company's financial performance significantly.
              * less inventory / better order fulfillment / shorter cash cycle time
              * better profit margin / better EPS (Earning Per Share) / higher ROA / less shortage of peers

#### Week2 ( data visualization/ predict trend)
* linear regression

#### Week3 (model validation and improvement, predicting the impact of price and other environmental factors)
* residual
   * purely random noise
      *  linearity - random distributed
