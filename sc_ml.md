# Supply Chain Machine Learning 

## Time series demand forecasting
* Time series EDA
  * autocorrelation: lag / autocorrelation plot (pandas autocorrelation plot) (if data is not stationary, the autocorrelation plot may mislead)
  * acf, pacf: to determin which lag value has straight impact to y
  * decomposition plot, with seasonal trend to determine seasonality
  * autocorrelation plot on decomposition seasonal plot to check seasonality and autocorrelation
* ARIMA
